# Security

Budgeteer is built to run **only on your own machine**. The threat model below assumes you
are not deploying it as a hosted service. If you do deploy it, almost none of these
assumptions hold.

## Assets

| Asset             | Location                                    | How it's protected                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bank credentials  | `data/budgeteer.db` (`bank_credentials` table)  | Encrypted with AES-256-GCM                                                                   |
| Claude API key    | `data/budgeteer.db` (`settings` table)          | Encrypted with AES-256-GCM                                                                   |
| Encryption key    | `data/.encryption-key`                      | File permissions `0o600` (owner read-write only). **Not encrypted itself.**                 |
| Transaction data  | `data/budgeteer.db` (`transactions` table)      | Plaintext inside the SQLite file                                                             |

## What's protected at rest

Bank credentials and the Claude API key never sit on disk in plaintext. They're
encrypted with a 32-byte random key (`data/.encryption-key`) using AES-256-GCM with a
fresh IV per write. Anyone who reads the DB file on its own cannot decrypt them.

## What's NOT protected at rest

- The encryption key file itself is plaintext (hex). Anyone who can read both
  `data/.encryption-key` AND `data/budgeteer.db` can decrypt your credentials.
- Transaction data (merchant, amount, date, category) is plaintext in the SQLite file.
  Anyone with disk access can see all your spending.

The right defense for both is **full-disk encryption on your laptop** (FileVault on
macOS, BitLocker on Windows, LUKS on Linux). Turn it on.

## Network surface

The dev server binds to `127.0.0.1` only, so it is not reachable from your local network
or the internet. The library only contacts:

- Your bank's domains (e.g. `digital.isracard.co.il`), via Puppeteer
- `api.anthropic.com`, only if Claude is your AI provider
- `localhost:11434`, only if Ollama is your AI provider
- `www.google.com`, the favicon API for bank logos (only the domain name leaves your
  machine, no credentials)

You can verify this yourself by running with `mitmproxy` or Charles.

## Chromium sandbox

The scraper launches Chromium via Puppeteer. By default we leave Chromium's renderer
sandbox **on**: if a compromised bank page or a chained Chromium CVE ever triggers RCE
in the renderer, the sandbox contains it instead of handing an attacker the same OS-user
privileges as the Budgeteer process.

The sandbox works out of the box on macOS, Windows, and most Linux installs. It fails to
start in two scenarios:

- Running as root on Linux
- Running inside a Docker container without the kernel capabilities the Chromium sandbox
  needs (most off-the-shelf images)

In those cases, set `BUDGETEER_DISABLE_CHROMIUM_SANDBOX=1` in your environment. When you can,
prefer running as a non-root user instead, which keeps the sandbox on.

## CSRF defense

The Next.js proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) rejects any mutating API request
(POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) whose `Origin` or `Referer` header doesn't match the app's own
host. This stops a malicious tab in your browser from triggering syncs or category
changes against your localhost.

## Browser security headers

Configured in `next.config.ts`:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, no embedding in iframes
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy`, with camera, microphone, geolocation, and payment all disabled
- `Content-Security-Policy`, restricting script/style/connect sources

## Dependency hygiene

The credential-touching libraries are pinned to exact versions in `package.json` (no
caret prefix):

- `israeli-bank-scrapers`, scrapes your bank with your password
- `better-sqlite3`, reads/writes the DB file
- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, sends data to Claude

Run `npm run security:audit` to check for known vulnerabilities and
`npm run security:outdated` to see if anything is out of date. Re-audit after every
upgrade.

## Threats this design accepts

| Threat                                          | Why we accept it                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local attacker with file system access          | Out of scope for a local app. Use full-disk encryption.                    |
| Compromised laptop / malware                    | Out of scope. Don't run untrusted code.                                    |
| Supply chain attack on a transitive dependency  | Real, mitigated by pinning + `npm audit`.                                  |
| Bank changes its UI and the scraper breaks      | Library updates fix this; we pin so they don't auto-upgrade.               |
| Bank blocks/flags automated logins              | Possible. Many banks tolerate it; some don't.                             |
| Memory dump of the Node.js process              | If you can do this, you've already won.                                    |

## What to do if you're more paranoid

In rough order of effort vs. benefit:

1. **Enable full-disk encryption** on your laptop (highest payoff)
2. **Enable login notifications** at your bank
3. **Use a unique strong password** for the bank account (not reused)
4. **Pin dependency versions** (already done for the sensitive libraries)
5. **Audit `node_modules/israeli-bank-scrapers/lib/` once** to convince yourself it only
   touches bank domains. About 300 lines per scraper.
6. **Use a separate, low-limit credit card** for daily spending and track only that one
   in Budgeteer
7. **Run sync with `Show browser during sync` enabled** the first few times so you can
   watch Puppeteer drive the bank's actual login page
8. **Monitor outbound network traffic** with `mitmproxy` or Little Snitch
9. **Move `data/.encryption-key` into your OS keychain** (macOS Keychain, Windows DPAPI,
   Linux Secret Service). Not implemented yet, see the roadmap below.

## Roadmap improvements

These would meaningfully harden the app. None are required for a personal local install;
each adds friction in exchange for additional defense.

- **Master password to unlock the app on startup.** Derive the encryption key from the
  password via Argon2id. Removes `data/.encryption-key` from disk entirely.
- **OS keychain integration** for the encryption key (macOS Keychain via `node-keytar`,
  etc.).
- **Whole-DB encryption** with SQLCipher instead of just the credential columns. Hides
  transaction data from anyone with disk access.
- **Per-credential key wrapping** (KEK/DEK pattern) so a compromised key only exposes
  one credential at a time.
- **Audit log** of every API mutation with timestamps.

## Running it always-on

Budgeteer does not ship a service installer. You run the server yourself with `bun start`,
and if you want it always-on, wrap that command in your own service manager (a macOS
LaunchAgent, a systemd user unit, a Windows scheduled task, `tmux`, etc.). Whatever you
use, these properties hold:

**The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`.** The `bun start` script hardcodes
`-H 127.0.0.1 -p 2412`, so the dashboard is reachable from your machine only, never from
your LAN or the internet. Do not change the host flag to a non-loopback address. Run your
service manager under your own user, not as root / SYSTEM.

**The health endpoint discloses minimum information.** `GET /api/health` returns
`{ok, version, hasDb}` and nothing else: no transaction counts, no provider names, no
setup status. Add to it only if you've thought carefully about what a local cross-app
attacker could learn.

**Logs do not leak credentials.** The app avoids logging credentials (see "What's
protected at rest" above). If you redirect `bun start` output to a file, store it
somewhere only your user can read (for example a directory with mode `0700`).

**The encryption key file's permissions are asserted at startup.**
`src/server/lib/encryption.ts` reads `data/.encryption-key` and refuses to start if the
file mode is not `0600` (POSIX only; Windows relies on the user profile ACL). If you ever
`chmod 644` the key file by accident, the server fails loudly with the fix command.

**What running always-on does not protect against:**

- A local attacker who can already run code as your user. They can read the DB and key
  file with or without the server running.
- A malicious browser tab on your machine doing a CSRF against `127.0.0.1:2412`. The
  same-origin proxy in `src/proxy.ts` already blocks this on every mutating request, and
  that protection works the same whether the server runs on demand or always-on.
